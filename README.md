 # What Goodies Can Be Found In This Repository?
   Within this repository, you will find a file named "San-holiday-challenge2019.md", which gives a basic breakdown, step-by-step walkthrough on how to tackle the KringleCon challenges if you are ever stuck! We've decided to give back those who have an interest in completing the walkthrough, so they can go ahead and knock out the challenges and overall grasp a deeper understanding of the challenges and how they play a role within the CyberSecurity world! Also, a folder named "images" can be found, and those are the images associated with the walkthrough! It'll make more sense once you browse through. :)
